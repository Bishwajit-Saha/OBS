        <p>Online banking, also known as internet banking, e-banking or virtual banking, is an electronic payment system that enables customers of a bank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial transactions through the financial institution's website. The online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the core banking system operated by a bank and is in contrast to branch banking which was the traditional way customers accessed banking services.</p>

    	<div id="heade2"><h1>Opportunities</h1></div>
        <p> To access a financial institution's online banking facility, a customer with internet access would need to register with the institution for the service, and set up a password and other credentials for customer verification. The credentials for online banking is normally not the same as for telephone or mobile banking. Financial institutions now routinely allocate customers numbers, whether or not customers have indicated an intention to access their online banking facility.</p>

        <p>While technology has altered the way loans are being disbursed, the canons of prudent borrowing remain unchanged. It still doesn't make sense to borrow if you don't need the money. Or take a long-term loan only to enjoy the tax benefits available on the interest you pay. Our expert advice lists out such immutable rules of borrowing that potential customers must keep in mind. Follow them and you will never find yourself enslaved by debt. </p>
